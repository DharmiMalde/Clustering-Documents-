# Custom K-means Clustering for Document Analysis

This project focuses on clustering documents based on their word frequencies using a custom implementation of the K-means algorithm. Each document is represented as a set of words, and similarity between documents is determined using the Jaccard index. The goal is to group similar documents together to identify underlying patterns and structures within the dataset.
